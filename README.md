# Consolidate Temp Control

Based on foosel's original [Proof of Concept](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint-ConsolidateTempControl/), this plugin consolidates the temperature and control tabs into one. Modifications to foosel's original source includes making the overall UI more compatible with widescreen displays and puts the temperature and control tabs next to each other instead of stacked on top of each other. Also implemented hack to hide original Temperature and Control tabs from view.
